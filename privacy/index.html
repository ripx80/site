<h3 id=relevant-legal-basis>Relevant legal basis</h3>
<p>In accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, we inform you of the legal basis for our data processing activities. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the privacy statement, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Art. 6(1)(a) and Art. 7 DSGVO, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our services and carry out contractual measures and respond to inquiries is Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our legal obligations is Art. 6(1)(c) DSGVO, and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 (1) lit. d DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p>
<h3 id=security-measures>Security measures</h3>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as access to, entry into, disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, deletion of data, and response to data compromise.

<p>If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called &ldquo;order processing agreement&rdquo;, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 DSGVO.</p>

<p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this happens in the context of using third-party services or disclosing, or transferring data to third parties, this will only happen if it is done to fulfill our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or allow the processing of data in a third country only if the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. DSGVO are met. I.e. the processing is carried out, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a level of data protection corresponding to that of the EU (e.g. for the USA by the &ldquo;Privacy Shield&rdquo;) or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations (so-called &ldquo;standard contractual clauses&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id=rights-of-the-data-subjects>Rights of the data subjects</h3>

<p>Cookies and right to object to direct advertising
Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers. Different information can be stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit within an online offer. Temporary cookies, or &ldquo;session cookies&rdquo; or &ldquo;transient cookies&rdquo;, are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online offer and closes his browser. Such a cookie may store, for example, the contents of a shopping cart in an online store or a login status. Cookies that remain stored even after the browser is closed are referred to as &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;persistent&rdquo;. For example, the login status can be stored if users visit them after several days. Likewise, the interests of users can be stored in such a cookie, which is used for range measurement or marketing purposes. Third-party cookies" are cookies that are offered by providers other than the responsible party that operates the online offer (otherwise, if they are only its cookies, they are referred to as &ldquo;first-party cookies&rdquo;).</p>
<p>We may use temporary and permanent cookies and provide information about this in our privacy policy.</p>
<p>If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online offer.</p>
<p>A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of the services, especially in the case of tracking, via the U.S. site <a href=http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU site <a href=http://www.youronlinechoices.com/>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.

<h3 id=deletion-of-data>Deletion of data</h3>
<p>The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 DSGVO. Unless expressly stated within the scope of this data protection declaration, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. I.e. the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.</p>
<p>According to legal requirements in Germany, data is stored for 10 years in accordance with §§ 147 para. 1 AO, 257 para. 1 nos. 1 and 4, para. 4 HGB (books, records, management reports, accounting vouchers, commercial books, documents relevant for taxation, etc.) and 6 years according to § 257 para. 1 nos. 2 and 3, para. 4 HGB (commercial letters).</p>

<h2 id=integration-of-third-party-services-and-content>Integration of third-party services and content</h2>
<p>We use within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) to integrate content or services offered by third-party providers, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as &ldquo;content&rdquo;).</p>
<p>This always requires that the third-party providers of this content are aware of the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is thus required for the display of this content. We endeavor to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo;) for statistical or marketing purposes. The &ldquo;pixel tags&rdquo; can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.
