## dmesg

rip is the instruction pointer of 64-bit registers and he is interupting vector 0x80, on linux systems its used for system_calls.
the pseudo name was created when i read the book "the art of exploitation" since few years and handle with the eip on 64-bit systems :-).

i love the linux system and uses gentoo if i have a lot of time and for security proposes. but when i have some trouble i switch to arch linux...
because i have not 45min to compile the newest firefox. at the moment i experimenting with nixos.

i use this blog to remember me what i have done and how i had done.

well, i hope you find some stuff for you on this upcomming website.
