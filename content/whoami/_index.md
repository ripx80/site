## dmesg

rip is the instruction pointer of 64-bit registers, and it interrupts vector 0x80. on linux systems, it is used for system calls. the pseudonym was created when i read the book the art of exploitation a few years ago and started working with eip on 64-bit systems.

i love the linux system and use gentoo when i have a lot of time and for security purposes. however, when i run into trouble, i switch to arch linux… because i don’t always have 45 minutes to compile the latest firefox. at the moment, i am used with nixos.

i use this blog to help me remember what i have done and how i did it.

well, i hope you find something useful on this upcoming website.
