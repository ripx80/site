only after quite a while i heard approaching footsteps behind this impregnable facade.</p><p>cautiously and sleepily the two-meter high monstrosity opened and an old gray man squinted through the crack of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;closed,&rdquo; he grumbled with a slight auric accent. his voice sounded old and somewhat strained by the years, but clear and strong.
&ldquo;i have traveled far, kind sir. would you have a little something for my accusing stomach?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t open for another two hours,&rdquo; the old man replied firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;i would also be satisfied with a trifle and pay good coin for it&rdquo;. promptly i rustled my purse at my hip, which, though not entirely empty, still held enough ready for a meal and a large beer from the home cellar.
he looked at me and my outfit and decided that he was not entirely averse to the clinking smell he heard.</p><p>&ldquo;all right, but i still have work to do. the kitchen doesn&rsquo;t open for a few hours but i still have preserves and a piece of bread from yesterday.&rdquo;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s quite enough for me, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>the heavy oak swung inward and an aging taproom opened to my view.</p><p>&ldquo;come in and sit at the counter over there,&rdquo; he pointed to a small nook on the far wall. he disappeared into a small door to the right.
as i entered, the comforting smell of past feasts, carousals, and spilled beer that had bonded with the floorboards came to my nose. the dim light in the taproom revealed various wooden tables and chairs. in itself, nothing special, it was simple but still felt, somehow &mldr; secure, especially in these times.
when i had taken a seat in the corner, the old man came out of the catacombs of this dwelling again and put a bowl of bread and beans in front of me. he pointed to two containers on the counter:</p><p>&ldquo;help yourself, raisins, a merchant left them for me and i&rsquo;m not really a friend of them. i&rsquo;ll be glad when they are gone&rdquo;. then he silently disappeared again.</p><p>after i had consumed the quite passable beans and the somewhat dry bread, i decided to try my hand at the raisins.
i reached into the first container and to my surprise it contained no raisins only a note on the stand stained brown from the previous contents:</p><p>&ldquo;it will not always be like this.&rdquo;</p><p>unsuspecting and not waking my mind, i grabbed the second container. this one was well filled, but in my attempt to pull out a handful of this sweetish food, i saw another note that appeared to be the same:</p><p>&ldquo;it will not always be like this.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=journey>journey</h2><p>disclaimer: this mental journey is not at the end and i think it never will be. so only take what you want and think about yourself, but the parts together.</p><p>after a three month trip through colombia without a warm shower, good bread (germans loves bread) and no time alone with a lot of fruits and the sun in my face a question came to my mind:</p><p>what i need realy? which requierements i have build in my life? consciously or unconsciously?
how i define freedom and how i can archive and beware?</p><p>with the fifth tinto (columbia black coffee with a little sugar) i begun my self reflection which continues to this day.</p><h2 id=needs>needs</h2><p>what i need as a modern man and what are the differences between me and ohter humans or other times and places?
i talk to some people and i aspect some commonalities:</p><ul><li>we need a coffee in the morning</li><li>we need a beer or wine in the evening</li><li>we need time alone</li><li>we need friends</li><li>we need watch tv to unwind</li><li>we need the internet for entertainment and news</li><li>we need a nice bed to sleep</li><li>we need special food to eat</li><li>we need music to workout/run</li><li>we need alcohol to socialize</li><li>aso</li></ul><p>and whats about our circumstances? sure, we need enough space in a plane! and when its unconftible we are unhappy or stressed.
but isnt it a good option to react of these things in a different way?</p><p>the more often we have the same thing every day, the more likely they are to become a requirement.</p><p>only the imminent move to a new apartment allows this topic to consciously resurface.
what i will take? what i will leave behind and which items, rituals or imaginations i will keep with me?
to get closer to this certainty i have developed a <a href=https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html>human log</a> for my purposes:</p><ul><li>coffee</li><li>alcohol</li><li>weight</li><li>sleep time</li><li>food (junk food, fruits, vegetables)</li><li>gaming</li><li>sport</li></ul><p>and i track these habits:</p><ul><li>coffee: 3-4 cups a day</li><li>alkohol: weekly, i enjoy a selfmade beer</li><li>shower: daily</li><li>food: daily bread consumtion</li><li>gaming: 2 hours daily</li></ul><p>what i will change, at least i a specific direction?</p><ul><li>reduce coffe to two cups a day (50%)</li><li>the week alcohol with only a maximum of 2 drinks each (two beer rule)</li><li>three times sport in a week (run/workout/swim)</li></ul><h2 id=source-envbinactivate>source env/bin/activate</h2><p>but sometimes our environment could be a problem to our intentions</p><ul><li>advertising, form a wish to a requirement. so if they do the job right we must increase our requirements over time.</li><li>our friends and family influence us</li><li>we change sometimes</li></ul><h2 id=human-space-programm>human space programm</h2><p>what are our requirements as human?</p><ul><li>food</li><li>water</li><li>sleep</li><li>toilets</li><li>hygene (stay healthy)</li><li>form of social contact (psyche)</li><li>home / safty place</li></ul><p>a interesting point is what the <a href=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/162514main_human_needs.pdf>human space programm</a> of the nasa see as necessary for a human. above all, not only the physical condition is evaluated but also the mental one. no one would live every day like making a long journey in space. but especially the mental aspect can be considered in daily life.</p><ul><li>what helps me to reduce emotional stress?</li><li>how do i become more resilient against physical stress?</li><li>what do i enjoy in my life, it should also make joy ;-)</li></ul><p>questions i will think about requlary</p><h2 id=how-hard-it-can-be>how hard it can be</h2><p>how hard it can be to get stuff i think that is necessary to me:</p><ul><li>how hard it is to get stuff: working hours</li><li>how hard it is to get stuff away: you canot throw it in the bin</li><li>how hard it is to rent a apartment/house/garage for your stuff, each qm3 costs money: work hours</li><li>how hard it is to take care of your stuff: car, bicicle, motorbikes, boats, aso, when you have no fence to paint you dont must paint your fences.</li><li>how hard it is to take your stuff with you: when you move to a new location</li><li>how hard it is to respect your house animals requirements</li></ul><p>= things get complicated, expensive, and time consuming</p><h2 id=technical-requirements>technical requirements</h2><p>i can only work on this os</p><p>i can only work with this special fancy computer</p><p>i need a headset with noise canceling</p><p>i need this special ide to code correctly</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>#/bin/livesh</span>

and at the same time, very few of them are really in our hands. one only has to think of a crisis in which the sunflower oil runs out and one can no longer prepare one&rsquo;s beloved tostones (fried plantains).</p><h2 id=think-sources>think sources</h2><ul><li><a href=https://neilkakkar.com/requirements-checklist.html>neil</a></li><li><a href=https://mnmlist.com/>mnmlist</a></li><li><a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/software_requirements_specification>srs</a></li><li><a href=https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-software-requirements-specification-srs-document>srs-doc</a></li><li><a href=https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/>python-packages</a></li><li><a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html>rust dependencies</a></li><li><a href=https://docs.rs/system-deps/latest/system_deps/>system deps</a></li><li><a href=https://www.dev-insider.de/was-ist-eine-dependency-a-899057/>what is a dep</a></li></ul></article><div><div>tags:
